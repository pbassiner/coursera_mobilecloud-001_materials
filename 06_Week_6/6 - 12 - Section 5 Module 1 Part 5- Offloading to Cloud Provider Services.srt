2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,833
A beautiful aspect of the cloud,

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:14,785
regardless of if you're using platform as
a service or infrastructure as a service,

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:19,140
is that you can take advantage of
really sophisticated services.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,700
That the cloud provider offers,
that you probably wouldn't be

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,350
able to cost-effectively, or
efficiently manage yourself.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,520
Now, many of these really complex
services, things like Big Cable, or

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,810
Dynamo DB,
they might going to be outside of your,

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,248
sort of, area of expertise for
your particular organization.

10
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:42,130
Or, you maybe a lone developer that's
building a mobile application and

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,930
setting up, and managing something
like Amazon Dynamo DB, and

12
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,020
guaranteeing its performance
could be really hard to do.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,530
Amazon however can hire that really
specific expertise needed to

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,590
build something like Amazon DB.

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,300
And actually, you know, monitor it and
ensure that it scales and ensure it

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,370
meets its service level agreements to
you because they're amortizing their

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,760
costs across thousands of customers
that are all using that infrastructure.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,522
Whereas you would just be
amortizing your costs across the,

19
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:15,480
you know, the level that you could use it.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,150
So it would be harder to amortize
all of the development and

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,030
set up and other costs.

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,680
So all of these cloud services
that the provider gives you.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,750
Allow you to get access to very
sophisticated capabilities that might,

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,880
might not be cost effective, or
might not even really be within the re,

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,820
the realm of capability for
your organization to take advantage of

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,540
without a cloud provider
there to support it.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,990
So one thing you should think about when
you're building your application is what

28
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,460
to offload to the provider,
versus do yourself.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,310
And there's a number of things
you should think about.

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,340
One, the cost, is it really going to
be cheaper for you to do this yourself?

31
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,830
And in many cases it's not,
and this will be cheaper.

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,930
It, if the cloud provider is amortizing
this cost across thousands of clients,

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,590
many cases they can offer
it cheaper than you can.

34
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,580
So for example, Google Drive is
now incredibly cheap to use.

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,720
You can get a terabyte of cloud
storage for ten bucks a month, or

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,430
something along those lines.

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,710
And who knows it may be even cheaper
by the time I'm done with this lecture.

38
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:35,994
So it may be very hard for you to provide
an equivalent, you know, highly available,

39
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:40,560
highly performing cloud
data storage system.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,950
And to compete with Google or
maybe you can.

41
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,120
So cost should be a big,
you know, consideration.

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,850
The cost shouldn't just include,
how much it would cost you to go,

43
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,118
and buy the hard drive and
connect it to the network.

44
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:56,310
The moment that you incorporate that
hard drive into your application,

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,050
you're going to have to manage it and deal
with it for as long as you're using it.

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,290
And it may be easy to manage one hard
drive but as your application scales and

47
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,650
grows you're going to suddenly be stuck
with managing thousands of hard drives,

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
or maybe you're going to
be dealing with more.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,410
And suddenly when you
start having failures, and

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,450
you're starting to have to think about
scalability and dealing with all of

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,200
the issues regarding buying more
hard drives, and plugging them in.

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,170
The management costs may not make sense,
so

53
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,460
in the small it may not
make sense to you offload.

54
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,830
In the large you know, particularly
if your organization can't scale up

55
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,970
fast enough, and
hire people fast enough, and

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,340
build all of the expertise to manage
the things fast enough, it may be much,

57
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,330
much more expensive to do it
yourself than to use a provider.

58
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,950
Or maybe it is the other way around, but

59
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,050
you have to think about, you know,
what do you really want to do yourself?

60
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,520
If you are a small organization,
it's going to be very hard to

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,830
compete with the capabilities that
the cloud provider can provide for you.

62
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,770
And if you are a single
developer building a mobile app

63
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,840
it's going to talk to a cloud service
you're almost always going to want to

64
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,730
tap into the things that
the providers give you.

65
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,710
Now, here's some of the interesting
capabilities you should be aware of,

66
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,620
that are out there in the Clouds.

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,490
One is CDN, Content Delivery Network.

68
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,550
So, the providers will give you the
ability to take static content that you

69
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,860
would like delivered very quickly
to your mobile clients, and

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,800
to distribute it and
cache it across the world.

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,340
So that whoever is requesting it can
get a very close and quick copy of it.

72
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,798
Another one are their database services,
particularly for

73
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:42,389
their no SQL databases,
where you don't have to worry about,

74
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,456
how you're going to scale up and
manage a databases.

75
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:50,535
You can just go and tap into something
like Big Table or Amazon Dynamo DB or

76
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:54,290
whatever it is,
what other database you're using.

77
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,130
Providing all the infrastructure to
support the database and manage it,

78
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,160
takes so, you know, a lot work, and
you know you could certainly go and

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,850
set up your own instance of whatever
particular database you want.

80
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,420
If you really want to do MongoDB and
manage it yourself.

81
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,260
You can do that, or you can try to
find a provider who will set up, and

82
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,730
manage Mongo for you, or a provider
who has Dynamo DB and tap in it yet.

83
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,668
So you need to think about
content delivery networks,

84
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:26,990
databases, cloud storage.

85
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,140
So this is a particularly useful
thing if you're going to be,

86
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,600
for example, uploading videos.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,520
And there may be interesting pricing
symmetries particularly if you're

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,710
operating a particular provider's cloud,
that make it make much more

89
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,720
sense to also leverage their
service that they're providing.

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,180
So to give you an example of this let's
say you're uploading videos and you,

91
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,080
to Amazon's cloud.

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,070
And you can either upload those videos to
your servers, that are running on virtual

93
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,800
machines in EC2, and then have those
servers store them directly in S3, or

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,420
on disk or somewhere else or you can have
the videos uploaded directly to Amazon S3.

95
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,950
Well an interesting thing is all
of your traffic into S3 to store

96
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,120
those videos would be free.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,180
You would only pay to serve
the videos out of S3.

98
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,460
However you're traffic to send the videos
if you route them through Amazon EC2.

99
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,020
And then store them on disk or
send them of to S3 or somewhere else.

100
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,070
That traffic isn't free.

101
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,620
You, depending on how you're configured
the IP addresses, you may be paying for

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,940
the actual bandwidth, but either way,
you're going to be paying for

103
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,810
the fact that your servers are going to
be tied up to some degree.

104
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,210
They're going to be consuming bandwidth
that's allocated to upload the videos.

105
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,420
They're going to be having
CPU cycles to process and

106
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,200
manage those incoming
requests to upload videos.

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,080
And then they're going to be using
up outgoing bandwidth to send those

108
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,430
videos wherever they're going to go.

109
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,051
So in sit, situations like that, although
you might like to have that extra layer of

110
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:07,479
control, just going directly to something
like S3 maybe more cost effective if

111
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,520
you're already running on Amazon.

112
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,780
So you have to think through those issues.

113
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,880
But if there was one issue that I
think should drive your decision to

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,180
use a provider services versus your
own expertise and custom built thing,

115
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,930
is to think about if my application
suddenly scaled up a 1000 times and

116
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,000
it happened next month.

117
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,710
Could I grow fast enough to support that?

118
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,530
Could I grow as an organization and
hire people fast enough?

119
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,580
Could I go and buy physical infrastructure
if I need to do that fast enough?

120
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,533
Could I support all of the things
that are going to be required,

121
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:51,840
including architectual changes, which
could be very difficult to implement,

122
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,730
in order to support that scale of growth.

123
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,130
And if you would all have an app that
you're expecting to grow like that,

124
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,270
then it's, and you can't answer yes to
that question, then you should go off and

125
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,470
think about using the provider's
services absolutely.

126
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,960
Because the fact that you can simply say
I want more capacity, give it to me,

127
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,440
and I will pay you for it.

128
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,690
And typically a lot of these things
get cheaper the more of it you use.

129
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,960
Your costs may go down as your capa,
as your demand goes up.

130
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,920
Whereas if you're managing all of
these architectural, hiring and other

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,050
complexities to scale your organization,
your application up and you don't

132
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,620
know if you can even do it fast enough if
your application starts growing quickly.

133
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,870
It doesn't make sense to try
to do it in the first place.

134
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,050
Build from the beginning
with the plan to offload.

135
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,420
Now some people get worried about,

136
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,750
well what if I get locked into a
particular, service provider and then for

137
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,630
the end of time, I'm going to
have to have my data over there.

138
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,440
It's always possible to build
your application in smart ways.

139
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,870
So using things like dependency injection
and spring, you can build interfaces that

140
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,840
abstract away the details of these
individual services provided.

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,710
Now you still have to understand
how they operate at some level so

142
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,160
that you don't treat a no SQL
database like a relational database.

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,740
But you can build interfaces
to help decouple you

144
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,250
from their specific APIs and
implementation.

145
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,480
And there are lots of ways to either
migrate out of a particular provider or

146
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,170
to even, you know, distribute your,
your business across multiple providers.

147
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,340
And there are frameworks out there
that can help you to do that.

148
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,610
But when you're building your application,
think about, can you scale up

149
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,578
quickly enough in each of the areas
that you're going to need scalability?

150
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:46,660
If you can't, very carefully think about
what cloud provider services are there

151
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,100
that you could take advantage of to
allow yourself to scale quickly.

152
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,230
And what would be the cost of doing
it yourself at a small scale versus

153
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,010
a large scale and the same thing for
using a particular provider.
