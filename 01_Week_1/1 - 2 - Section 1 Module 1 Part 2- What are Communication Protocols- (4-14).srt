1
00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:08,753
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:11,267
So what do we need if we're going to talk

3
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:15,090
to a server that's sitting remote from our
mobile device?

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,395
So we've got our mobile device that's
sitting here, and we're

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:25,230
going to communicate between it and some
cloud resources.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,151
So what do we need to do in order to
support that interaction?

7
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:34,150
Well, one of the most important things we
have to do

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,260
is we have to select a protocol for
talking to that cloud.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,090
How do we go in about and talk to

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,200
the cloud, the cloud, and that's what a
protocol is.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,570
A protocol is a set of rules dictating how
we

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,900
communicate with the resources on the
other end of this network.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,320
Now why do we need a protocol, or some
specialized

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,062
way of communicating, and what does the
protocol get us?

15
00:00:57,062 --> 00:01:00,610
So if we just go and make a local method
call,

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,760
this is going to be, you know, very, very
fast, nearly instantaneous.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,460
But when

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,850
we go and do some communication over the
network, for example,

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,120
we communicate over a cellular connection
to resources that are sitting

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,230
in a cloud that could be, you know,
thousands of miles

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:27,180
away, this could be milliseconds to
seconds to do that communication.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,130
So there's a substantial longer period of
time to establish that connection

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,540
to transfer data and to receive some type
of response that we're waiting for.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,240
So a big question that comes up is, well,
how long is too long?

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,740
When should I disconnect from that server
and

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,368
assume that my communication from my
mobile device failed?

27
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,940
because, we've all experienced it, where
you're driving along

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,440
and suddenly your call drops because your
signal goes away.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,510
Well how does that cloud know when it's

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,630
been too long since it's heard something
from you?

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,130
Or, what if you go and log in to a
website, when

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,680
should it, decide to de-authenticate you
and make you log in again?

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,700
All of these things are aspects of the
protocols that we

34
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,490
design in order to communicate with some
other entity that's farther away.

35
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,810
And it's really important to have a

36
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,370
robust protocol for this communication to
ensure that

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,540
we interact securely and reliably and
quickly with

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,940
the resources that we're trying to
interact with.

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,900
So to give you an example, think about the
Mars Rover

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,750
that, that NASA has launched and been
controlling from the earth.

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,490
When they send a message from Earth to the

42
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,550
Mars Rover to drive it or control it, it
can

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,010
take a substantial period of time for that
message

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,790
to receive, to be received on Mars by that
rover.

45
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,870
It's not milliseconds or seconds on the,
it's on the order of hours.

46
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,610
So think about it, you're driving this
rover, and

47
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,290
suddenly it hasn't received a message in
an hour.

48
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,760
What should it do?

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,530
How should it respond?

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,670
Should it keep going at 50 miles an hour
or 10 miles

51
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,090
an hour or however fast the rover goes, or
should it stop?

52
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,730
Should it try to return to where it
started from?

53
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,350
So this is what a protocol defines, is

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,740
it tells you how you communicate with
another entity.

55
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,600
And it defines a syntax, or basically a
format, for

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,610
the messages that you can send to that
other entity.

57
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,470
So it says, when I send a message, it has

58
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,790
to have these properties to it, and that's
the syntax.

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,830
It defines semantics, and this is
basically the meaning of the messages.

60
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,330
So if I send you message A and then I

61
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,570
send you message B, here's what I mean by
that, I

62
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,000
don't want you to get confused, I want you
to

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,780
understand the semantics of my messages,
or the meaning of them.

64
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,510
And then it spells out the timing, so I if
I send you

65
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,120
message A, how long do I have before I
should send you message B?

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
Or should I even send you message B at
all?

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,380
Should I send you something else instead?

68
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,720
So building and selecting the right
protocol for the interaction with the

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,260
cloud is one of the most important aspects
of mobile to cloud interactions.
