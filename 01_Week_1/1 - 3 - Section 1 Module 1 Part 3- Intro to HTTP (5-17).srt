00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,458
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:14,190
So how do we talk to 150,000 servers in
Amazon EC2?

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,380
How does a lonely little mobile device,
that's

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,690
connected to some network, out in the
wild.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,460
Get access to these thousands of servers,

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,090
that are sitting in some cloud computing
environment.

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,690
So how do we get from there to there?

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,810
Well the way that we're going to talk
about getting from the

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,060
mobile device to the cloud is through the
use of HTTP.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,290
And what you can think of HTTP is, it's
basically a dialog or a language

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,980
that a mobile device can use to speak to a
cloud, it's a protocol, an application

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,030
protocol, for communicating between
devices on a network.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,350
Now.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,520
We're going to use HTTP here as our
protocol for communication.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,830
But it's helpful to have a little bit of
history.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,340
And understand what HTTP, was originally
built for.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,330
HTTP is the protocol, or the way that your
browser communicates with a web server.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,410
In order to retrieve resources from that
web server such as a web page.

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,930
So when you go and you log in to Facebook,
for example, your browser is sending

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,160
HTTP, probably a series of HTTP requests,
to one or more Facebook servers.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,130
And then that server, or servers that are
receiving the request or requests.

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,150
Send data back to your browser.

23
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:48,970
HTTP is a client-server protocol and what
that means

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,710
is that, the interactions that are
mediated

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,750
via the HTTP protocol, are always
initiated by a client that wants to.

26
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,300
Access or request, some resource on the
server.

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,440
So the server has a series of resources,
that it can provide to

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,190
the client, and the client sends requests
for those resources and the server.

29
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,220
Returns responses to those requests.

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,930
And the responses may have the resource
that was requested or it may have a

31
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,780
message indicating why the Server could or

32
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,370
couldn't process the request, that the
client sent.

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,476
But fundamentally, the HTTP protocol is

34
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:42,300
an application protocol that is
client-server.

35
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,550
So, the client will always be initiating
the communications.

36
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,050
And there are some changes to this with
newer things

37
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,070
like web sockets, that we'll talk about
later in this course.

38
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,580
But in general, the client will always
start the interaction.

39
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,580
And the server will receive the
interactions.

40
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,620
And process them.

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
So, this is the fundamental way, that HTTP
works.

42
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,680
Now the client can be either a mobile
device as we'll

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,790
focus on in this class, or it can be a
browser.

44
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,470
So, we can have a mobile device be the

45
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,330
client, or we can have a browser be the
client.

46
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,710
Or we could have some other device, maybe
in

47
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,530
the internet of things, we use HTTP as the
protocol

48
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,010
to communicate between different pieces of
equipment in a

49
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,500
factory and the different controllers,
that are monitoring their status.

50
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,470
So HTTP is a general purpose protocol.

51
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,310
That can be used, to communicate between a
client and a server.

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,430
Now one of the reasons that HTTP has
become so popular for mobile

53
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,540
integration with cloud, is that HTTP is a
widely used protocol already.

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,160
All of the websites that you visit are
already using.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,760
HTTP as the protocol that's being used to
access those web res, resources.

56
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,450
So there's already so much infrastructure
that's been built

57
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,560
up and so much investment that has been
put

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,440
into HTTP protocol, and so much
understanding of how

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,180
the HTTP protocol works, that
organizations naturally want to reuse.

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,490
That infrastructure and investment, on
their mobile platforms.

61
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,850
So by using HTTP, they can write a server
side, that provides access

62
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,850
to these resources, which could be a
service, or could be a web page.

63
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,020
And, they can provide a common interface
to those resources, through HTTP.

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,920
It's a common protocol and a common server
site interface, to access those resources.

65
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,950
So when a server sends a response back, it

66
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,240
doesn't necessarily have to care whether
the person or thing

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,790
that's consuming that response is a mobile
device or a

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,950
browser, or some other thing that it's
never seen before.

69
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,850
As long as that thing knows how to speak
the HTTP protocol,

70
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,730
it can consume the resources and services,
that are available on that server.
