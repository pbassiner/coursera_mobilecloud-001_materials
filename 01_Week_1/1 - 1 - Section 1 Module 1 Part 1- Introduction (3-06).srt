00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:11,910
Hi, I'm Jules White from Vanderbilt
University.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,480
And welcome to my course on

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,829
programming Cloud Services for Android
handheld systems.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,914
So there's different estimates, but people
estimate that Amazon has between

6
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:27,852
150,000 and 450,000

7
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:34,270
servers that are backing its public cloud
that you can get access to.

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,270
Similarly, there are estimates that Google
and Microsoft

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,070
have over a million different servers that
are

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,100
backing their infrastructure that they use
to support

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,830
things like Gmail, or Google search or
Bing search.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,780
So cloud services have become really a
fundamental capability that

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,100
you need to be able to build really large
scale

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,000
and compelling applications, like Amazon
and Google and Microsoft do,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,090
or the many start-ups that are doing
really fascinating things.

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,780
So what this course is about is how do you

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,520
build scalable, secure Cloud services that
communicate with mobile devices?

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,230
Now there's lots of material on building
web based services.

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,270
But this course is going to focus
specifically on services that live in the

20
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,480
cloud and talk to mobile devices, using

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,690
protocols like the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol, or HTTP.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,530
And how do we use things like the Java

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,620
Spring framework to receive requests over
HTTP and process them.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,930
And then what are the special issues that
we have to think about

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,470
when we're storing data in cloud specific
data storage, like a key value store?

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,780
Where maybe we don't have the same query
capabilities that we normally did.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,370
How do we architect things differently?

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,870
That's what this class is going to focus
on.

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,760
And hopefully, what it will give you the
ability to do is to

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,940
create really compelling and fascinating
applications that

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,200
take the data from a single device

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,770
or multiple devices, send it to the cloud,
and process it, combine it, and

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,050
store it in a way that you just couldn't
do on an individual device.

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,820
Because at the end of the day, although
mobile devices are

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,350
really impressive, a single mobile device,
a single Android device that we're

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,130
going to run, is never going to be quite
as compelling

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,080
as that device when it's connected to
100,000 servers, or 1000 servers.

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,110
Or maybe it's just ten servers, and each
of these

39
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,920
servers has significantly more computing
power than that single device.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
So this class is about how we connect
these

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,980
devices to this cloud to build
applications that span these

42
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,000
resources that allocate things to the
right place in the

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,140
stack and do things in a scalable and
secure manner.

44
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,500
So I look forward to working with you
through the next several weeks

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,420
to understand how we build really

46
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,880
compelling cloud services to support
mobile devices.
