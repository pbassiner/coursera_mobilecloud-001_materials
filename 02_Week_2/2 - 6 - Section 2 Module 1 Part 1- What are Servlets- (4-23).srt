[MUSIC]

00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:11,736
The Java technology that's used to handle

3
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:15,690
incoming requests on a server, is
typically Servlets.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,930
So what Servlets do, is when a browser,
where

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,727
in our case a mobile device, sends an HTTP
request.

6
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:29,164
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:36,045
This request gets routed to what's called
a Web Application Container.

8
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:40,130
So this is often just called a Web
Container,

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,549
and inside of the web container, there are
one or more Servlets

10
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:55,270
that handle and process the HTTP requests
that are being sent to it.

11
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,480
So the request will reach the web
container and then be routed to one of

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,770
many individual Servlets typically, that
are running inside of that web container.

13
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,402
Now, what a Servlet is, is it's just a
Java object, that

14
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:18,010
has special methods for handling incoming
HTTP requests.

15
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,759
And the key methods that a servlet has,
are doGet,

16
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,470
doPost, and you can probably see a pattern
here.

17
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,758
You have do methods for the various
request

18
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:39,710
methods, that are part of the HTTP
specification.

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,730
So this Servelet is nothing more than a
Java object,

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,400
that inherits from Servlet and has
implementations of the various request

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,220
handling methods, that correspond to the
various HTTP request method.

22
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,100
So if somebody sends a Get request for
some resource

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,190
like Foo, it's going to pick out a
Servlet, it's going to route

24
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,780
that request to the Servlets doGet method
and then that doGet

25
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,080
method gets access to all of the different
pieces of the request.

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,590
Namely, the request line where we can look
at for

27
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,635
example, the resource that was requested,
it gets access to the

28
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:29,830
Headers and it gets access to the request
body, so

29
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,500
they can go and do any processing
associated with that request.

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,310
So, Servlets are the underline and most
commonly

31
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,750
used technology in Java, for handling the
incoming request.

32
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,220
Now, one of the key questions is, if we
have multiple Servlets here, how do we

33
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,890
decide which Servlet should handle a
particular HTTP request?

34
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,070
Well, inside of most web containers,
there's

35
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,920
what we call basically a routing function,
or

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,160
some router which decides based on the
request

37
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,780
that's coming in, which Servlet should
handle it.

38
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,640
And in Java, the way that Servlet handling

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,570
and routing is specified, is through a
web.xml file.

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
And this is a specialized file that tells
the web container when a particular

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,050
request comes in, so let's say we get a
new request here for slash-bar

42
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:38,782
and it's a post to bar, it looks in the
web.xml file, finds the Servlet

43
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:44,500
that it should go to, and then routes the
request to the appropriate Servelet,

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
based on what's specified in that web.xml
file.

45
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
So this is essentially the routing of
requests.

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,170
This is where routing is specified as in
web.xml.

47
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,432
The web container handles the life cycle,
and uses this routing table to

48
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:04,969
decide which Servlet should receive
requests,

49
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,949
and then the individual Servlet's process
request.

50
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:14,689
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,882
So, this is the overview of how the

52
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:23,620
Servlet system in, in Java works, to
handle requests.
