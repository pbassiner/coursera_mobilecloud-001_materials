[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,980
It's really important to understand the
details of the HTTP protocol.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,700
In order to build and debug effective
cloud services.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,420
So let's talk about those details in some
more depth.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,250
So the HTTP protocol is always organized

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,050
around a client sending a request to the
server.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,770
So we have our server and our client and
we have a request that's being sent.

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,390
Now, one of the key parts of that request
is the action

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,610
that the client is asking the server to
take on its behalf.

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,910
And so every request has a request method.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,490
And the request method, is the action or
the verb that

12
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,666
the client is asking the server to take on
its behalf.

13
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,660
And all requests are dictated as a request
method that

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,750
should be applied to a specific resource
on the server.

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,580
So for example, when you go and access a
webpage, using your browser.

16
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:30,310
What you're typically doing is sending a
request that has the get request method.

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,450
So it is a get request, and the resource
is usually some webpage

18
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,060
like index.html, which is usually the.

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,740
Core webpage at a website, when you go to
that, that address.

20
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,409
So the get is the request method, and the
resource is the index.html.

21
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:58,800
And the resource is typically specified as
a path to a resource on the server.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,560
So the resource will typically be a path.

23
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:10,430
So you'll see something like get, you
know, /index.html or fu/mypage or

24
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:17,629
some other resource that you would like to
access.

25
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:22,540
And here again it's a Request method, and
then a path to a resource.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,570
So let's talk about the H [INAUDIBLE]
request methods.

27
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,020
There's a variety of them in the protocol,
but there's a subset of

28
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,690
them that we really care about for

29
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,190
communicating between mobile devices and
the cloud.

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,220
One of the most important ones that we
want to understand is Get.

31
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,010
Get is a simple request to the server it

32
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,640
can be without data or possibly include a
little

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,050
bit of data and it's asking the server to

34
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,550
get some resource that's there and return
it to us.

35
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,680
So we're going to talk about the important

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,440
HTTP request methods, that we really care
about.

37
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,060
So, this is one of the HTTP request
methods is GET.

38
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,920
Another really one, important one is POST.

39
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,600
POST is typically used when you want to
send a lot of data to the server.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,050
So, for example, if you want to go and
Post an image to the server

41
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,210
that it can then store and serve up at
some later point in time.

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,100
Post is probably something you will be
using to do that.

43
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,010
Get you probably aren't going to be
sending an image through get.

44
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,150
You're going to be sending some small
amount of data through Get.

45
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,949
Post is your more general purpose send
data to the server.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,620
These are your two most important, but
there's two

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,000
more that's worth knowing about having
some familiarity with.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,230
Another one is Put is asking a server to
store

49
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,990
some data that is contained within the
request on the server.

50
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,640
And the last one you probably want to know
about is Delete.

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,770
And it's fairly self explanatory.

52
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,250
We weren't asking the server to delete
some information on the server.

53
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,757
So when you're sending HTTP requests,
you're always going to specify an HTTP

54
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:21,663
request method plus a path or resource.

55
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,200
That you want that method to be applied to
you.

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,520
So, I want to get this particular
resource.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,640
I want to put this resource on the server

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,660
or I want to delete this resource in the
server.

59
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,680
So whenever you're sending a request,
you're always

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,900
telling the server the specific action or
request method.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,470
That you would like to be taken on that
particular resource.
