1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,078
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:13,166
Using Session cookies isn't
really the most convenient way of

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:18,411
authenticating mobile devices and, and
remembering the users associated with

4
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:23,540
the mobile devices that are sending
requests to your Cloud service.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,540
So let me give you some examples
of why sessions aren't ideal.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,670
So let's say that we have a server.

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,390
And we have access to various
resources on that server.

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,490
So we might be able to upload video,
we might be

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,150
able to delete video
that's in our account.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,600
And we might be able to get a list
of the videos that we've uploaded.

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,520
Now, if I'm writing a cloud
service that I intend for

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,170
different mobile apps to use,
I need a way of allowing some mobile app.

13
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,420
That's running our device.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,740
So let's say, we've got our Android device
here, or some other device like an iPhone.

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,570
We've got all of these different apps.

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,250
So we've got App 1, App 2,
and they're going to be

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,150
sending requests to the server
to get access to our video data.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,530
So you can imagine YouTube and
other sites deal with stuff like this.

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,750
And so, App 2 may send request to
the server to get access to our video.

20
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,730
App 1 may send request to our server
to get access to different aspects of

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,870
the videos that we've uploaded.

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,100
Now, how do those apps go and
establish their identity and

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,790
associate themselves with me and
my user account, so

24
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,190
that they can get access to my
information, either upload new videos or

25
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,240
delete videos, or
list the videos that I've uploaded?

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,130
Well, if we're just using
the standard session approach, that

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,240
we've used before where we create session
cookies after logging in a log in page.

28
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,990
Each app would basically display a login
that would say, you know, give us your

29
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,560
username, and it would have a box, and
then it would have a box for the password.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,740
And it would collect all of
this information from me, and

31
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,310
then just pass it along to the server.

32
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,760
And each of these apps
might go about doing that.

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Now, let's say that I want to
not have to login every time.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
Well, this app may say, okay, well,

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,930
you don't have to login every time, I'll
just store your username and password.

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,920
And then this app says, oh,
I'll store your username and password too.

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,020
And very quickly we get into this
situation where our private information,

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,570
our username and password is being
stored by all of these different apps.

39
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,870
And the security of how well it's stored
is determined by the weakest link.

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,960
The, the first app in here that goes and
stores it in plain text or

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,130
doesn't do the proper encryption or
other things hashing to protect it,

42
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,460
the, the, the easier it is for
an attacker to gain access to it.

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,860
So we don't really like this idea that
we're going to provide our user name and

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,390
password to each app.

45
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,860
And then each app is going to store that
information and then provide it over and

46
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,740
over again to the server.

47
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,110
So that's one disadvantage of this model
where we're going to use session cookies.

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,510
Another disadvantage is,
let's say that I really trust App 2.

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,970
So this is an app that I really,
really trust.

50
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,280
I give it a little check mark here.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,500
I really trust App 2.

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,200
This is an app that's produced by
a really well known app developer.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,730
But App 1, eh, I sort of trust them,
but I want to try that app out.

54
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,250
Well, even though I trust this
app a lot more, there's no

55
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,650
way that I can differentiate the access
that they should have to my account.

56
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,770
So either one I'm going to give
my username and password to.

57
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,450
They're both going to be able
to login the server, and

58
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,010
they're both going to have
full access to my account.

59
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,050
So they'll both be able to upload videos,
delete videos, and list videos.

60
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,650
And what if I really wanted
to try this app out,

61
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,690
but only give it
the ability to list videos?

62
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,540
Or maybe it only needs to
access to list videos.

63
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,490
So, let's say that this
is just a viewer browser.

64
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,950
Well, it shouldn't have access to
upload and delete videos if it doesn't

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,750
need the access, but with this username
and password model, each app is going to.

66
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,010
Potentially store, but at the very risk,
get access to my username and password,

67
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,020
and be able to use it to authenticate
with the server and do everything.

68
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,180
So, I don't really want every app to have
full access to my account and I especially

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,020
don't want every app to have full access
to my account if they don't need it.

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,640
Because the more times I give
out my username and password,

71
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,020
the more apps that improperly protect it
or store it, and the less they actually

72
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,470
need to use it the more I'm exposing
myself to a security vulnerability.

73
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,900
The more I'm offering up my account
to be attacked and compromised.

74
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,360
So, what we need is a way
to allow apps to get

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,780
access to certain resources that
are associated with my account.

76
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,140
So we want one app to just
have access to list my videos.

77
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,910
And maybe we want another app that
we trust more to have access to

78
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,250
listing the videos and to deleting them.

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,380
So we're going to give this to App 2.

80
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,010
This one to one and two, and
we're not going to give delete access to

81
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,880
any of the apps because none of them,
we don't trust any of the apps that much.

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,560
Well, this type of model isn't
supported well by a username and

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,460
password that generates a session
cookie that gets stores in an app and

84
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,010
used to access data in my account.

85
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,300
There's no granularity in
the control of the access.

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,940
And we have that fact that either
we're providing the username and

87
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,730
password to the app every single time
we want to use it, or that app is

88
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,380
storing it on disk, so it may be going and
storing it somewhere on your device.

89
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,410
And then this app may be going and storing
your username and password somewhere else.

90
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,876
Otherwise they're forcing
you to login every time and

91
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:37,340
the app developers don't want to do that.

92
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,940
So suddenly we are having our username and
password stored all over the place.

93
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,610
We can't govern access to the resources in
our account on any type of granular level.

94
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,080
And it ends up being a situation
that's not ideal for

95
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,580
a mobile environment and for the concept
of having different apps that have

96
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,280
access to different parts of our account.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,820
The model of storing usernames and
passwords were

98
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,410
requiring the user to provide them every
time also has some other disadvantages.

99
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,740
That we don't really
like in a mobile model.

100
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,690
So let's say that we
have multiple apps again

101
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,430
that we are working with that
we want access to our data.

102
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,060
So we have A1 again.

103
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,310
And we've got a second app.

104
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,180
And maybe you have other apps on
multiple devices, so we might even have.

105
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,930
Other devices where we've got yet

106
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,655
more apps that also are getting
access to our accounts.

107
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,800
There we've got a tablet,
we've got some other things.

108
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,930
So we've got all of these different apps.

109
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,180
Well, suddenly we're storing our password
in a lot of different places, for one.

110
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,460
If these apps are storing it.

111
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,490
Or we're having to type it in over and
over again.

112
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,320
But we're also got some other things.

113
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,146
Let's say that,
these apps are storing our password,

114
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:57,320
when it's very possible they
are because they want to be convenient.

115
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,630
And suddenly I want to change my password,
because this is something that is a good,

116
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,330
typically considered to be a good security
practice is to continually update and

117
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,150
change your password.

118
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Well every time I change my password.

119
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,730
I'm going to have to go and
change it here, here, here and here.

120
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,490
So, as a user I'm going to start
feeling probably a little lazier, and

121
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,080
thinking I really don't want to go and

122
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,830
update my password in ten different
Apps every time I change it.

123
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,070
So, I won't change it as often.

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,940
Another issue is, that, let's say
I decide to give this app access.

125
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,070
There's no way for

126
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:45,190
the server to participate in the decision
of what this app should be able to access.

127
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,980
So for example, the server may want to
say this app can only have access to

128
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,660
certain things because
that's just my policy.

129
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,730
But the server's not
involved in this process.

130
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,560
You give your user name and password
to this app, and the app goes off and

131
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,450
talks to the server.

132
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,340
And the server doesn't get to decide what
the app can or can't have access too.

133
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,340
You tell the server,
it has access to my whole account.

134
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,990
So, the server isn't involved
in the process access at all.

135
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:23,010
Another thing is, what happens if I decide
that I no longer trust this app over here?

136
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,230
So, I don't trust this app,
but I trust the other three.

137
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,670
Well, the only way to revoke that trust of

138
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,710
that first app of it storing
my username and password.

139
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,660
Is have to go, and
completely change my password,

140
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,140
on the server side so
that this app can no longer log in.

141
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,760
And the result is that this app is no
longer going to have access, this app will

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,670
no longer have access, and that app
is going to no longer have access.

143
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,480
So this user, name, and
password to get a session cookie.

144
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,560
That model just doesn't
really make sense for

145
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,260
the mobile environment where we'll have
multiple apps, that will have access

146
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,650
to our data, and potentially need access
to different subsets of our data.

147
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,840
And we may trust some apps
more than other apps.

148
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,690
But if we're just sending a password and
getting a session cookie back.

149
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,630
And letting whatever app wants it,
use it to get access to our full account.

150
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,150
We're beginning to create all kinds
of security problems that are,

151
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,580
at least not ideal situations for
our cloud based service.

152
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,400
What we really want to do,
is we want to be able to control access to

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,140
the resources that are associated
with the user's account.

154
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,540
At a finer level of granularity.

155
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,010
We don't want to train the user
to just give up their password to

156
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,620
any app, at any time.

157
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,470
We want the server to be able to make some
decisions, about which app should and

158
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,450
shouldn't have access to a user's data.

159
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,230
And we'd also like, for
the user to be able to go and

160
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,810
change their password without.

161
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,080
Effecting all of the apps that they
want to have access to their data.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,630
Similarly, we'd like to be able to go and

163
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,830
revoke access to our data
just to a specific app.

164
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,870
But, all of these things
aren't really possible or

165
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,520
easy to do at least,
with the model where you log in, and

166
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,820
get a session cookie back that gives
apps full access to your account
