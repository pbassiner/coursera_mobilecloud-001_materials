00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:08,341
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,786
So why are we using a web browser

3
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:15,650
protocol to integrate mobile clients with
cloud services?

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,170
Why do we want to use HTTP to talk to the
cloud?

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,080
Well HTTP provides us a number of nice
properties.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,260
One is, we've got a uniform interface that
we can provide via

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,750
HTTP to the services or resources that are
sitting on the server.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,460
And, for example, if a client is a Browser

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,865
and sends a request over HTTP and that
Server

10
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:45,430
rec, receives that request, the request is
exactly the

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,280
same as if a mobile device had sent it.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,520
So, if this is a Mobile device that's
sending that request, either way

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,080
on the other side, on the server side,
that request still has to conform

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,450
to the same requirements and
specifications of the HTTP protocol.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,000
So we can have a common interface.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,154
This is one of the big advantages of

17
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:16,639
using HTTP to interact with cloud
resources and services.

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,800
Is we don't have to go and rewrite

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,340
everything from scratch and figure out a
whole

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,110
new way of having our servers accessible
and

21
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,530
having mobile devices able to communicate
with them.

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,830
We can reuse what we're already building
and providing

23
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,852
to our browser based clients and the web
is ubiquitous.

24
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:41,230
Everybody's building websites, everybody's
supporting web service as it is.

25
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,721
Why not reuse this infrastructure for
mobile?

26
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:48,740
And so that's one of the big reasons
behind using

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,710
HTTP to support mobile and cloud
interactions.

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,030
Now, we get a number or of other great
things as well.

29
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,170
There's already all kinds of stuff on the
server side from a

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,460
framework and programmatic perspective
that we can use to process HTTP requests.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,390
So there's things for doing stuff like
sessions

32
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,030
or remembering when people request
something, who that

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,660
person is and what they previously
requested or

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,190
what other data is associated with their
current login.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,850
We also get things like Data marshalling.

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,430
This is very important when you want to
convert from the format of

37
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,880
the HTTP request to some other format that
you need to process.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,470
And there's a huge amount of
infrastructure that's already

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,640
been developed, in terms of libraries and
frameworks, that

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,670
you can use to program if you use HTTP

41
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,270
as your underlying protocol for your
interaction with the cloud.

42
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,360
But there's also a number of other reasons
that it's really nice to use HTTP.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,920
There's also infrastructure that decides,
how do we

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,310
load balance and distribute requests
across our servers?

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,450
So for example, if you have a million
people accessing your, your

46
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,530
service simultaneously, how are you going

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,280
to distribute those requests across those
servers?

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,970
So, Load Balancing infrastructure for HTTP
can be reused

49
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,270
if we're using HTTP as the communication
mechanism with the cloud.

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,150
So there's such a significant investment
both in the existing frameworks and

51
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,980
libraries, the load balancing and other

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,240
management infrastructure that's been
developed for HTTP.

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,360
It's natural to use HTTP as an interaction
mechanism with the cloud.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,180
Now, as we'll see later in the class,
there's some challenges to

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,500
using HTTP, particularly when things that
we would like to do with

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,040
our mobile services don't fit into the
client server model where the

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,070
client is always the mobile device
requesting some resource from the server.

58
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,360
So maybe an email comes into the server

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,310
and your client needs to be notified about
it.

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,160
Well that's difficult to fit into the HTTP
model.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,600
But we'll talk about how we overcome some
of those challenges later in the lessons.
