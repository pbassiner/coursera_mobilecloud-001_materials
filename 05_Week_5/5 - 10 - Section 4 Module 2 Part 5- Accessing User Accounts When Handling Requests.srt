>> Spring Security can control access to
the methods in your controllers

3
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:16,990
without you ever having to do anything
other than annotate those methods

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,338
with information about the roles or other
expectations you have about the

5
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:26,020
user accounts associated with the clients
that are sending you the requests.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,590
But there are cases where you would like
to have information about the user

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,700
possibly to add information that you're
persisting

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,070
in the database or do something else.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,320
So, let's take an example.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,180
So, let's go to back to our video service

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,460
and let's say we have our video service
controller.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,235
And this would have all of the nice
controller annotations, other things, and

13
00:00:53,235 --> 00:01:00,594
we have a method in this controller like
public we'll just call this boolean.

14
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,663
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,866
Upload video.

16
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,802
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,380
And there might be a video object or
something else.

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,920
But let's just say that it's a, we're
going to ignore all the other parameters.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,820
Now, inside of this upload video method I
might want to do something

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,620
like, video v equals new video.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,150
And depending on how you are passing all
of this stuff in you might set

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,740
some things, and then what I'd really like
to do, is I, before I persist this thing

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:43,148
in the database, I'd like to say setUser
and pass in a user,

24
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:48,580
or a username or something like that, in
order to store it in the database.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,680
So, now when I'm persisting the object I
have a notion of who uploaded that video.

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,170
Now, if Spring Security is handling all of
this and I've

27
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,280
never seen the users, I can't do something
easy like this.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
So what we have to do is tell Spring
Security

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,900
that it should pass us the information
about the current user.

30
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,560
And the way that we can do that is all we
have

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,330
to do is add an additional parameter to
our methods called principle.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,579
And then we can do something like this, we
can say, string user

33
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:33,597
equals p.getname.

34
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:38,100
And basically what this is doing is
telling Spring,

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,500
whenever you invoke this method, we want
you to pass

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,230
in the principle, or the current
authentication the information

37
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,550
about the user that's sending the request
into this method.

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,840
And so it will pass that into you as an
object.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,880
And there are ways to extract the actual
object

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,280
that you would get from a user detail
service.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,350
If you provided your own user detail
service you

42
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,210
can get that user details object out of
the principal.

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,630
Or you can just get basic information like
the name of the principal out of it.

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,200
And then use that information to
associate, for example, resources that are

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,250
being uploaded with the actual user
account that uploaded that resource.

46
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,320
So.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,850
Simply by adding an additional parameter,
and it

48
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,260
doesn't matter what the ordering of that
parameter is,

49
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,300
just if you have a principle parameter at

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,300
all, you can get information about the
current user.

51
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:42,772
So this parameter is going to be the
current user account.

52
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:47,550
And if no one is logged in this would
obviously be null.

53
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,950
So, these types of methods where you're
taking a principle as an

54
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,690
argument almost always need @PreAuthorized
or secured or one of the other

55
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,340
annotations to specify some security
information so that

56
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,570
no matter what Spring knows that before
you call this method, you

57
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,490
have to force the person to log in so that

58
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,950
Spring can get the principal and provide
it to you.

59
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,040
There's other ways to do it without

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,120
the annotation in your configuration of
Spring.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,160
You could just say that this is a method
that requires full authentication.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,970
In which case, Spring will always make
sure that if a client sends a

63
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,720
request, that they have to authenticate
and

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,460
create a session before this method gets
invoked.

65
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,540
And that way their principle information
will always be there so that

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,119
you can find out about the current user
account that's invoking the method.

67
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,980
Although we can get access to the
principle in our methods, a lot of times

68
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,360
we don’t actually need to do that in order
to provide some more advanced security.

69
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,860
So, let’s take an example with the upload
video.

70
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,560
So let’s assume we have this video service
and the users

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,620
can go in and post videos that are
going to be uploaded.

72
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,030
There postings in JSON that's being
converted

73
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,110
into a video object by Spring for us.

74
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,870
And inside that video object one of the
fields that

75
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,860
we have is some information about the
owner of that video.

76
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,765
Or this could be a delete method where we

77
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:19,630
are going to go and delete a particular
video.

78
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,580
But one of the things that we might want
to do is enforce the rule that

79
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,240
when you upload a video, whoever is listed
as the owner has to be the user that's

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,210
currently logged in, because we don't
somebody to

81
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,620
go and upload a video they don't own

82
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,150
or to upload a video and then have

83
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,140
the owner set to someone other than their
account.

84
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,960
We always want the owner to be associated
with them.

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,640
The way that we can enforce this is, in
Spring

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,960
we can use a more complex expression in
our @PreAuthorize.

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,572
We can actually say, hash video, because v
is the

88
00:05:57,572 --> 00:06:03,347
parameter, .owner equals principal name.

89
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:08,243
And what this is telling Spring is, in

90
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:13,139
order to invoke this method, not only

91
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,035
must the client have a current session

92
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:23,237
established, that's associated with

93
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:28,439
a user that's known, but the video that

94
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,500
you're sending here, in this case, v.

95
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,572
The owner member variable of that video
down here has to match the name

96
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:43,159
of the current principle, or the
user-account

97
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,110
associated with the client that's sending
the request.

98
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,990
So we're not only restricting this method
and saying

99
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,000
certain users, for example, could have
access to it.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,015
But we can also restrict the format or

101
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,880
the requirements in the data that they are
sending.

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,800
So, in this case we're creating a
relationship between the video

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,140
and its owner and the currently logged in
user and the name.

104
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,770
So this is the username of the client.

105
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,700
So whatever client has logged in and
established a

106
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,120
session, this is going to be the username
of that.

107
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,200
And this is going to be data that's coming
from the user, this video.

108
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,630
So this came from the user, or the client.

109
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,270
So, we're forcing them to make sure that
when they upload

110
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,250
a video that they are matching the
ownership to their username.

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,110
And so, we can have all kinds

112
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,950
of sophisticated expressions in these
@PreAuthorize annotations to

113
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,320
control access and control the
relationship between the

114
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,900
data and the user that's sending the
request.
