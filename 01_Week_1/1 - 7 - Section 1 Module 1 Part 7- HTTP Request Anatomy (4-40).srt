00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:08,389
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,963
Whenever a client sends a request to a
server using

3
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:15,970
HTTP, that request has to have a very
specific format.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,350
I mean, just think about it, if you're
that server

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,290
receiving all of these requests from all
over the place.

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,910
You have to absolutely make sure that they
all have the same format so

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,030
you can interpret them properly and figure
out the right thing to do with them.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,190
And that's why HTTP, very strictly
specifies what the

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,910
format and the rules are for sending that
request.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,139
So let's talk about the Parts of a
Request.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,860
So we have our HTTP Request.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,260
And, each HTTP Request has a number of
critical, some mandatory

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,270
and some optional, parts that have to be
sent to the server.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,580
One of the first parts that has to be sent
to the server is the Request Line.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,060
And the Request Line specifies two really
important things.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,890
The first thing is it specifies the
Request Method.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,679
And the second thing that it specifies is
the Resource.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,750
That we want to take action on, which is
typically specified as a Path.

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,040
So these are a request part.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,300
Now, this is the key thing.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,280
We're going to say, server, please go and
take this action.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,790
On this particular Resource.

23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,030
But when that server gets that Request
there's lots of cases where

24
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,520
it may have multiple options for how it
goes and completes that request.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,010
For example, let's say that we have a
webpage on the server, and it's the

26
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,740
homepage of that particular web address,
so you go to the Equivalent of google.com.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,300
Well, sometimes the server needs help
knowing some

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,270
information about the client that can help
it to

29
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,390
complete that request, things like the
language that

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,170
the client would like to receive the
response in.

31
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,730
So, the next piece of the request is a
series of Headers.

32
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,390
And what we can think of these is extra
information to help the server.

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,890
And these were things like the language
that

34
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,990
we would like the response to come back
in.

35
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:42,900
Or the character set that we would like to
see the response in, or the content type,

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,560
what we're sending back to the client so

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,350
it knows how to interpret it and process
it.

38
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,190
Or possibly something like the cookies or
small pieces

39
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,340
of data that were sent from the server to
the

40
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,470
client in a past request that the client's
now

41
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,970
providing back to the server to help it
figure out.

42
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,030
Where it was or who this person is, and
associate them with past requests.

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,470
So the Headers are the second key
component of a request, and they provide

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,120
extra information to help the server
figure

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,920
out the right way to process the request.

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,250
A final piece of information that can be
part of an HTTP Request.

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,430
Is the Request Body, and the Body is any
data

48
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,450
that the client is sending to the server,
in order to help it complete the request.

49
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,598
Now, this an optional part of a request,
and not a

50
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,620
100% required, but let's distinguish it a
little bit from the Headers.

51
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,280
The Headers are meta information, things
to help

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,020
it know the right way to process the
request.

53
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,810
The Body is core data that is being sent
to the server to process the request.

54
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,660
Now one way to think about this is in most
cases.

55
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,400
If you didn't include the Headers, but you
did

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,110
include the Body, the server could still
process the Request.

57
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,710
It just may not give it back to you in the

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,230
format that you expected or exactly the
way that you expected it.

59
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,470
But if you didn't include the Body and the
server

60
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,060
needed the Body, it wouldn't be able to
process the Request.

61
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,760
So the Body is the data the client is
sending, that

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,530
the server absolutely has to have in order
to complete that Request.

63
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,660
The Headers are extra information that the
client is

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,920
giving the server to help it complete that
Request.
