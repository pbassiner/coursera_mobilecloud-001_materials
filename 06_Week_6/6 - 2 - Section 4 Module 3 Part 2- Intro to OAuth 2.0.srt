00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:12,687
OAuth is a specification
that's designed to fix

3
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:18,840
these issues in the typical log in and
get a session cookie model.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,810
So.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,970
What OAuth does is give you a way to do
a lot of things much better in this model.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,430
One, is it tries to give you finer control

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,170
over the resources in a user's account.

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,950
So, we can begin to say things like, this
app should have access to upload videos,

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,440
but not delete videos in my account.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,874
It give us a way to revoke access,

11
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:58,907
to individual apps.

12
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:06,322
So, I can say I no longer
trust this particular app,

13
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:10,500
I will revoke access to it,
without having to change my password.

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,162
It allows things like changing a password,
without revoking access to all of my apps.

15
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:27,000
Or, if you want it to,
it can revoke access.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,140
But it begins to fix
a bunch of these issues.

17
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,860
It can also provide
a model whereby an app,

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,650
it can get access to your data or
some subset of your

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,526
data without actually directly providing
your user name and password to the app.

20
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:50,970
So, it doesn't, require,

21
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,480
user name, and pass going to the app.

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,590
So there are models with OAuth,
where you can actually go and

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:08,080
log into a particular website directly
through your browser or some other client.

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,790
And then that information that, that app
needs in order to get access to a part of

25
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,000
your account is given to the app
through another mechanism.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,330
So you don't directly have to
provide your credentials to the app.

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,722
OAuth is often called the valet
key of the web, and the reason is,

28
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:32,710
is because to support all these things
that we talked about, it provides a model

29
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,125
where essentially you can create a key
that can be handed off to an app.

30
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,050
That can only access specific
resources within your account,

31
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,680
that you want that app to have access to.

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,020
So it's like your car when you're going
to park your car and you give your car to

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,440
a valet who is going to park the car for
you, you can give your valet key,

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,900
which gives them the ability to turn
on the car, drive it, and park it.

35
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,980
And lock the doors, but not get access
to the glove compartment or the trunk.

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,160
Where you might be able to store you know,
sensitive data about yourself.

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,930
But I guess if it's a car
you're not storing data.

38
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,840
You're probably putting money or

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,170
other things into the glove compartment or
the trunk.

40
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,640
And so
the valet key is something that gives

41
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,100
the valet access to the part of the car
that they need, the ability to turn it on,

42
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,410
drive it, park it, and lock it.

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,310
But not access to the parts of the car
that they don't need access to.

44
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,800
In this case,
the glove compartment or the trunk.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,440
So, OAuth has a very similar model.

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,940
It allows you to create a key that
you can hand off to a specific app.

47
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,880
And that will give that app only
access to a part of your account.

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,100
And similarly at any time you can decide,
you know what,

49
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,520
I don't want that app
to have access anymore.

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,423
And you can revoke the key that you've
given into it without revoking your

51
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:59,640
master key, your user name and password
that you're using to mint these other keys
